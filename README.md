emacs-config-pythonists
=======================
It is realy a great job to collect things useful all-in-one. 
But after tried,  pymacs and rope worked not good enough, I recomment jedi for python and el-get for package management, though ert need to be installed manually.


== quoted from original == 
Contents of ~/.emacs folder for python programmers. Rope &amp; Ropemacs for refactoring. Pymacs and ido dot el hack for auto-completion. This is a functional Python IDE using emacs.i
