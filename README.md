emacs-config-pythonists
=======================
I forked this project here, due to rope cannot be fetched from rope.sf.net and the original project cannot be commented, btw, it is not a project bug, but some other network issue. 

Hope someone can help to put rope tar here, or email to me at bwlee.sky (at) gmail.com, thanks in advance!

Contents of ~/.emacs folder for python programmers. Rope &amp; Ropemacs for refactoring. Pymacs and ido dot el hack for auto-completion. This is a functional Python IDE using emacs.i
