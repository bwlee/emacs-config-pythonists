TODO

1. add flymake to help python coding and better python code style
   will use pylint + pychecker + pep8
   -- [done]

2. add quick access to python doc
   unfortunately, pylookup and python-info cannot be fetched now, is there any other choice?
   -- finally I used pydoc-info from el-get


3. add invokion to python testing framework, nose
   will use nosemacs,  any advice?
